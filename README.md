# Replica Data Analysis Project

This project is a replication of a beginner's first data analysis project. By replicating this project, I aim to gain insight into the process of data analysis and learn from the techniques employed by the original author @keith Galli.

## Introduction
In this project, I replicate the steps followed by the original author in their first data analysis project. This includes exploring a dataset, applying various data analysis techniques, and drawing insights from the data.

## Goals
- Gain insight into the process of data analysis.
- Understand the techniques used in the original project.
- Compare my results with the original analysis.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this replication project is in the repository

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for replicating the original analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with replicating this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. Refer to the Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts in the `notebooks/` and `scripts/` directories for replicating the original analysis.

## Contributions
Contributions to this replication project are welcome! If you have any suggestions, enhancements, or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to the original author of the data analysis project for providing inspiration and guidance.
